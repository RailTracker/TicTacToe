# TicTacToe
A simple jQuery/JavaScript implementation of Tic Tac Toe.

In the initial version, I implemented all of the basic rules, styling, and victory conditions.

I added a status header showing whose turn it is, who won, or if it's a draw.

It is functional and testable [here.] (http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/RailTracker/TicTacToe/blob/master/index.html)
